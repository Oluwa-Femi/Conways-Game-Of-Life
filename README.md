# Conways-Game-Of-Life

The Game of Life is not your typical computer game. It is a cellular automaton, and was invented by Cambridge mathematician John Conway.  This game became widely known when it was mentioned in an article published by Scientific American in 1970. It consists of a collection of cells which, based on a few mathematical rules, can live, die or multiply. Depending on the initial conditions, the cells form various patterns throughout the course of the game.

# MOTIVATION
The Conwayâ€™s Game of Life is an algorithmic problem first developed by a British mathematician named John Conway. The idea is to have a grid of cells and a set of rules that determine how the cells live, die and reproduce.

The challenge for the developer is to use the rules of the algorithm, and display the cells to the screen so that a user can visually experience how digital cells might live and die through a series of generations in a way that is both visually compelling and automated.

The game will be developed using React mainly because of the manipulation of states and to make the logic structure easy to write, read and understand.

Users will be able to run different "Game of Life" scenarios. It leads the reader through the fundamentals of Conways's "Game of Life" and the app was created using React and Javascript.

The codebase also contains algorithmic solutions to different scenarios and comments are added where necessary to show my thought flow.
